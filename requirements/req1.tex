The program is a text based minesweeper game written in Java. The generated board is 10 characters long (horizontal) and 5 characters down (vertical) in size. When started the program gives the user some useful commands: restart, exit and top. These commands will start a new game, quit the game and reveal the top five ranked players, respectively. The program reads the input, checking for the previously mentioned commands before determining if the user has entered a legal move. A legal move is on the format "row col" where row ranges from 0-9 and col from 0-4. When entered the program reveals the "hidden" character as either a number (from 0-3, minesweeper style) or a bomb, portrayed as '*'. In the case of the bomb the game requests the users name and then the game resets.
